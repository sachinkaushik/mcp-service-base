"""mcp-service-base — shared contract library for Central QSR Agent services.

Every service (real pipeline or simulator) presents the same contract to the
agent: emit an event -> durable log -> expose describe/subscribe/read/act.

The core is domain-agnostic. Services import it and add only their own event
schemas plus read/act tools.
